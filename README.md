# Visualization_Project_Shopping_Trends

The visualization project presented here is a deep dive into consumer behavior. It examines average review ratings across various demographic factors, product categories, seasons, and states. 
The primary question this visualization tries to answer is: How do average review ratings vary across different factors and product categories, and what trends can be observed in consumer behavior across different seasons and states?
The sub-questions we decided to explore are:
1.	How do customers' average review ratings for items differ across various states within different seasons?
2.	Which items purchased during different seasons receive the highest and lowest average review ratings, and how do these ratings vary by category?
3.	How do average review ratings, purchase amounts, and the number of previous purchases vary across different item categories and states during different seasons?
4.	How do average review ratings vary by gender across different age groups?
To address this question comprehensively, the project leverages a rich dataset sourced from Kaggle, encompassing detailed information on shopping trends, including review ratings, purchase amounts, item categories, and demographic data. This dataset offers a robust foundation for analysis, as it includes a diverse array of variables that enable a multifaceted exploration of consumer behavior.
This visualization project is particularly tailored for economics students, giving them a unique opportunity to research consumer behavior using real-world data. By working with these ground-level visualizations, students can gain hands-on experience in data analysis and interpretation, fostering a deeper understanding of the economic factors influencing consumer decisions.
In summary, this project aims to answer critical questions about consumer behavior and can serve as a valuable educational tool for budding economists. It equips them with the skills necessary to analyze and interpret extensive datasets.
